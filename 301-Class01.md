## Class 01 Notes
## Topic: Introduction to React and Components

- Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.
- What is a “component”? 
    - A component is a modular,portable, replacable and resuable set of defined functionality that encapsulating its implementation and exporting it as a high-level interface. 
    - There are 3 views.
        - object-oriented view
        - conventional view
        - process-related view.
- What are the characteristics of a component?
    - Reusability - Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
    - Replaceable - Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
    - Not Context Specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
    - Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
    - Encapsulated -  A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
    - Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
    -  The advantages of using componet-base architecture are the ease of deployment, its easier to replace existing versions with no impact on other components or the system as a whole. This also reduces cost of third part components, it allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
    - Ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliabile, system maintenance and evolution, and independent. 

  ### What is Props and How to Use it in React.
  - What is “props” short for? Props is short for "properties"
  - How are props used in React? In React props are used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are being passed in a unidirectional flow. (one way from parent to child). Props data is read-only. data from the parent should not be changed by child components.
  - Define an attribute and its value(data)
  - pass it to child components by using props
  - render the props data.
  - What is the flow of props? The flow is one way.











## Things I want to know more about 
- I want to understand props more and how to properly use classes.
