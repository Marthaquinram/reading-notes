# What Google Learned About Teams
- Julia Rozovsky is a researcher that graduated from Yale who went on to work for Google. In 2012 Google embarked on an initiative called Project Aristole to study Google teams in their success and struggles as the teams worked together. "After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. " "Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didn’t offer clear verdicts."
