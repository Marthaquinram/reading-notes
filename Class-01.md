### **Structure**:
HTML describes the Structure of the pages
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it defines the structor of your content. 
- The standard HTML Elements consist of an opening tag and a closing tag eg. <> </> (The forward slash indicates that the tag is closed) attributes of the tag and the content within the tags.

**Tag**
- A tag is another word or letter surrounded by brackets like < and >. You use tags to create elemeents like links,paragraphs or list. The characters within the brackets indicate the purpose of the tag.

**Attributes**
- An attribute is made up of two parts a **_name_** and **_value_**separated by an equal sign. Example: name="value"
- Attribute name should be written in lowercase and its indicating what information you are providing about the elements content.

- < html >

  < head >

    < title >
 Title of page
    < / title >

    </ head >

< body> 

< h1 > here is the body of page </ h1>

< p > displayed here will be main browser </ p>

</ body>

</ html>

## Extra Markup

### Doctypes
- Doc Type declaration is placed at the top of the page, this tells the page which version of HTML you are using. < ! DOCTYPE html>

### ID Attribute
- ID attibutes is used to specify a unique id  for an HTML element. It identifies it from other elements on the page.
- ID adttribute is also known as global attribute since it can be used on any element.

### Class Attribute
- A class attribut is used to identify multiple elements being different from the other elements on the page.

### Block Elements
- Block elemet starts on a new line, browers add some space before and after the element. 
- Examples of block elements are: < p>, < div>, < h1>, < ul>, < il>

### Inline Elements
- Inline element does not start on a new line. Everything will appear to continue on the same line as the element next to it. 
- Examples of inline elements are: < a>,< b>, < em>, and < img>

### Grouping Text & Elements in a Block
- < div> elemet defines a division or a section in the HTML document. This element is used as a containt for HTML elements and that gets styled with CSS.
- Using an id or class attributes on the < div> elements makes it so CSS can be used.
- use a closing < /div> tag.
