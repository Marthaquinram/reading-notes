# Readings: CSS Layout

### Layout
- position schemes that allow you to control layout of a page:
  - normal flow - the paragraph will appear one after the other, vertically down the page.
  - relative positioning- the second paragraph will be pushed down and right from where it would otherwise have been in normal flow.
  - absolute positioning - the heading is positioned tot he top right and the paragraphs start at the top left of the screen ( as the heading were not there.)
  - fixed positioning - the heading has been plained in the center of the page and 25% fromthe top of the screen.
  - floating elements - the heading has been floated to the left allowing the paragraphs of text to flow around it.
  - when you move any element from normal flow. boxes can over lap. the **z-index** property alls you to control which box appears on top.


  ### Normal flow
  - position : static - which does not renders the element in any special way, but in a normal way. Elements with positioning as static are not affected by any of the CSS Positioning properties (left, right, top and bottom).
- positionL relative -
