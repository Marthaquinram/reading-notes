# Javascript

What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the front-end and back-end side that allows you to make web pages interactive. JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

Javascript components

-Variables - Variables are containers for storing data like data values.
-Examples: 
 *var x = 5;
 *var y = 6;
 *var z = x + y;

 X, y, and z are variables. Declared with the 'let ' keyword
 let x = 5;
 let y = 6;
 letz = x + y;


 ### JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

Names must begin with a letter

Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

JavaScript Data Types

Variables can hold numbers and text values like "Jane Doe."
Text values are called Text strings. Strings are written inside of a single or double quote.
Example: 
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';

Declaring a JS Variable.
Declare a JS variable with the var or the let keyword: 
var carName; or let carName;
 To assign a value to the variable, use the = sign:
 carName = "volvo"
 let carName = "volvo"

 < script >
let carName = "Volvo " ;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
</ script >

Still having trouble understanding how Javascript works.
