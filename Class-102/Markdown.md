## Learning Markdown

*What is Markdown?*

Markdown is basic writing and formatting syntax aimed to make writing on the internet easier. It allows you to make things easier to read. Markdown allows you to make things **Bold** or *Italicized* by simply using ***syntax***.

Here are the syntax I have learned so far.

1. Headings
    - The # sign is used for choosing how large or small you want to showcase a word or sentance. For example
      - # Hi
        - ## Hello
           - ### Hola
   - The number # signs you enter in 6 being the most you can use will determine how big or small that word or sentence is.
   
 2. Styling
    - Then theres styling, this allows you to make words or sentences bold, italicized, Strikethrough, Bold and nested italic, and All bold and italic.â€ƒ
    - Here are some examples:
      - *Bold* Using ** ** or __ __
        - **Italicized** Using * * or _ _ 
          - ~~Strikethrough~~ Using ~~ ~~
            - **Bold _and_ nested italic** Using ** ** and _ _
               - ***All bold and italic*** Using *** ***

3. List
    - Making a list and checking it twice. This is how to make a list. You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with syntax of - or *.
    - Hi there
    * Hello there
    
 You can even make a numbered list too by simply using numbers.
 
    1. California
    2. Washington
    3. Spain
    
Markdown gets rid of all the distractions of a formatting toolbar and mouse clicks by helping you focus on your writing without lifting your fingers off of the keyboard. All in all this can save you so much time and make things easy to read.

Terminal

The commands I learned for the terminal are
- git clone - and then you enter the repo youre cloning.
- git status- to see what changes have been made
- git add . - to add all files you made changes to
- git commit -m "message here" - is letting the cloud know what changes you made
- git push origin main - this is what sends everything back to cloud to update so you have the latest version of what you've done.
