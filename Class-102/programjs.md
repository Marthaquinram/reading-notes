# Programming Javascrip Notes

- On the top of every JS page is ' Use strict '
- let is the variable 
- console.log is the output

- Prompt is a simple way of asking the user for input.
- prompt is to ask someone a question, it prompts up a box to input their answer.

# JS functions

- Functions are a way that we can categories or break down our code so only bits and pieces run.
- Usually JS runs from top to bottom
- group together code some kind of objective. we choose which ones to run. Functions are like receipes. bunch of actions that are group together.
- example:
  - function yourName(){
  - let name = prompt(' what is your name?');
  - console.log('Hello, ' + name)
}
- functions do not run until you call them
we can call our function - yourName();
git parameter ( these are the ())
- give it logic 
- give it a return

- let answer = prompt(' what is the name of martha\s dog?'); // Papaya

* === means its the exact strict answer
* == kinda equal truthy and a falsey
* if (answer ==== papaya ); {
* console. log (' great job! you are correct !' )
}

* !== means NOT EQUAL 
* ! is a (bang ), and that means NOT


* answer.toLowerCase ( ) normallizing the formating of the content.
* || means or : only one of the conditions in the statement has to be true

* && means AND : both or all conditions have to be true


# Loops!!

- Are the ability to repeat an action a set/some number of times.
- Guess a number between 1-100; or you can do trivia, ex. you have 3 attmepts to answer this question:

- How many cats do I have? <----- infinate amount of outcomes.

- simple structure/algorthim to solve the ability to repeat behanvior/loop

### 3 loops 

- while 
- do.. while
- for **

- start every while lop with "while"
- while(condition)
- whiles dont need a numeric condition.

cons: you control when it exits.

### the *do..while* 
- you keep running loop until the while condition is met.

### the *for* loop

- for loop : just inegers/numbers
- when we know the number of attempts that we need to make
- traversing through list


- 1st = defining/declaring a variable and give it a numeric value (- in -> +in)
- 2nd is the condition that must be met for the loop to run 

 * 3rd what happens to the variable/value once an interation is complete

* ++ means add once
- for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++>){
    console.log(i);
}
 - console.log(' im done' )

 - for(let i 5; i > 0; i+++){
     let answ = prompt ('you have ' + i + ' attempts left. What is my dogs name?')
 }
- if(answ === 'joise '){
- console.log('yaay');
i = 0
 }

 Notes are not complete. Im not fully understanding concepts. Im going to add more notes to this.
