# Revisions and the Cloud

# *Git vs Github*
## Git
Git is a version control system that allows manage and keep track of code history. It allows multiple developers work on the same code and collaboration. Git keeps all your files projects in one repository. Git allows you to take snapshots of your code at points in time and it keeps history of what snapshots look like.


## Github

Github is the cloud where your code is stored, the cool thing about Github is that it can be accessed anywhere in the world. If youre on a team with developers that live in a different state or country, they will be able to view changes and review changes that have been made.  
Github allows you to create repositories to then send down to the version control system which is Git, to make and build the content in your repository in your local machine. Once you've made changes in Git, commit and push to the cloud to upload the most recent version of your repository.

Here are some Terminal commands needed in order to get your git codes upto the github cloud.

- git clone - allows you to clone the repository in the cloud down to your local machine.
- git status- to see what changes have been made
- git add . - to add all files you made changes to
- git commit -m "message here" - is letting the cloud know what changes you made and taking a snapshot of where you did last
- git push origin main - this is what sends everything back to cloud to update so you have the latest version of what you've done and allows the other developers on your team see what changes have been made.
