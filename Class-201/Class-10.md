# Error Handling & Debugging
- Execution Context - Every statement in the a script lives in one of three execution contexts.
  - Global Context - code that is in the script, but not in a function, There is only one global context in any page.
  - Function Context - code that is being run with a function. each function has its own function context.
  - Eval context - text is executed like code in an internal function called eval()

  - Variable Scope - The first two execution contrxts corresponds with the notion of scope.
    - Global Scrope - if a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has global scope. if you dont use the var keyword when creating a variable it is placed in a global scope. 
    - Function- Level scope - when a variable is declared within a function it can only be used within that function. this is because it has function-level scopre.
