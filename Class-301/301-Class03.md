## Class 02 Notes
## Topic: Passing Functions as Props

- What does .map() return? - .map() returns a new array
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? - you can use .map() to create a new array, then 
- Each list item needs a unique. - A unique key.
- What is the purpose of a key?- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

## The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator?- refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  - Copy an array
  - Using Math Functions
  - concatenating or combining arrays
  - adding an item to a list
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  - const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}
  - const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}
  - const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
  - console.log(helloWorld) // Object { hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝", world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!" }

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  - const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
  - const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
  - console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]


- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
  - const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
  - const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
  - const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
  - console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

- In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
  - The first step they do is  creating the functions where the state is that is changing.
- In your own words, what does the increment function do? 
  - The increment function updating the parent state. by looping throught it
- How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
  -  You can use props to pass a method from parent to child component.
- How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
  - 


## Things I want to know more about
- I want to get more practice with everything with props and parent and child components.
