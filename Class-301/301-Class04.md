## Class 04 Notes
## Topic: React and Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - A Controlled Component is an input form element whose value is controlled by react.
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? 
  - event.target.name


## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained
  - condition ? value if true : value if false
1. Why would we use a ternary operator? - to shorten up code to one line.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

- if(x===y){
  - console.log(true);
- } else {
  - console.log(false);
- }
  - Ternary operator
  - x===y ? 'true' : 'false'
<!-- - if ( condition ) {
  - value if true;
- } else {
 - value if false;
- } -->
