## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding?
  - Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - They weren't designed to be used like that. Most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. 
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
- What does a GET do?
  - GET retrieves things, like  image, text, video, an MP3, a slideshow.
- What does a POST do?
  - if one systems needs to ***adds*** something to another system
- What does PUT do?
  - If a system wants to ***replace*** something in another system
- What does PATCH do?
  - If a system wants to do a partial update, it should use PATCH.
