# Class 03 Reading Notes

## Data Modeling

### nosql vs sql
1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?
  - SQL
2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL
3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
  - Vertical Scaling means that we simply increase the power of the database server
  - Horizontal Scaling on the other hand means that more servers are added and the database is distributed across them. Hence you still work with one database but multiple servers that host it.

### sql modeling techniques
1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

- We connect lines between tables to show relationships.  In some cases an entry in one table can be related to more than one entry in another.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___a___ of the database tables and their relationships.
  - create diagrams
3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
  - A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.
  - A foreign key is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.

### sql vs nosql
1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
  - 
2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.
  - we have to ensure however we are fetching the data, and whichever extra data we might have or whichever data might be missing that we bring it into a format which fits into that table.
3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.
  - one to one - one plane tickets has one passenger
  - one to many - one flight has many plane tickets
  - many to many - users can have multiple roles and roles can be assigned to multiple users.
