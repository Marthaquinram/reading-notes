## Linked Lists

### Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

- Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:
  - Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)
The amount of time a function needs to complete.
- Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)
The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.
- 4 Key Areas for analysis:
  1. Input Size - the size of the parameter values that read by the algorithm, it takes into account the size of each partameyer value as well. We will use the letter *n* to refer to the Input Size value. The higher this number, the more likely there will be an increase to Running Time and Memory Space.
  2. Units of Measurement - The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends. The number of operations that are executed. The number of “Basic Operations” that are executed.
  3. Orders of Growth - We can describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n. As the value of n grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.
  4. Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case -
  - Worst Case - Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n, This case runs the longest for all possible inputs of n.
  - Best Case - Best Case: The efficiency for the best possible input of size n, This case runs the quickest for all possible inputs of n.
  - Average Case - Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n. The average case makes a typical assumption about the possible inputs of size ‘n’ and how they might affect efficiency. This is NOT the best case and worst case averaged together.


### Linked Lists

- A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
- there are 2 types of linked List, a Singly and a Doubly.
- Directly copied from docs,

1.  "Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
2. Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
3. Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
4. Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list."

- Traversal - When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing.
- Using a while loop is the best way to approach a traversal. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.
- the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.
- Head/Start- we are starting from the beginning of the node linked list.
