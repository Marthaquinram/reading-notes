## Event Driven Applications

### Event Driven Programming
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
- EventEmitter
2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

- "The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other." 

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
