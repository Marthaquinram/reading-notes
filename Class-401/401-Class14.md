# Class 14

## Event Driven Architecture

### Lab Requirements
### Your application must employ the following programming concepts:

1. A “hub” server that moderates all events
2. Multiple “clients” that connect to the hub which can both publish and subscribe to events
3. Must operate over a network

### Optional:

- Engage an API that uses a database to store/retrieve information based on the events being triggered
- Employ a standard “Queue” to ensure all messages are properly delivered
- Employ a FIFO “Queue” to ensure ordered delivery of some events

### Presentation
On the due-date, your team will present a working version of your project to the class showcasing the following:

- General Functionality
- Wiring (quick overview)
- Code Review

Plan for ~15 minutes for your team’s presentation
