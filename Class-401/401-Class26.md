## Component Based UI

### react hello world

- The Reusability, Repetition Scalability, simpler maintenance and faster development.

### introducing JSX

1. What is JSX and why do we use it?

- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and we use it to describe what the UI should look like. JSX produces React “elements”.

2. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.

- makes our component more dynamic.  We declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
< h1>{formatName(user)}< /h1>

3. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.

- yes it is, "By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks."


### rendering elements

1. Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.

- components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

2. Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?
  - mutability allows you to change a value without creating a new value,
3. If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?
  - it updates the state.
