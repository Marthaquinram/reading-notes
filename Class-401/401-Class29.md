## Advanced State with Reducers

### useReducer hook

1. Name an alternative to the useState Hook.

- userRender

2. Why might the useReducer Hook be preferable to the useState Hook?

- When you have a complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

3. What are two ways to set the initial state?

- The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument
  - const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    {count: initialCount}
    );
- You can also create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an init function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to init(initialArg).
