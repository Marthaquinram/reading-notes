## Context API - Behaviors

### Hooks and Context example

1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do? - it accepts a value prop to be passed to consumer components that are descedants of the this provider.
2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role? - "you would create context using create context and wrap the context provider around the component tree. put the value you like on your context provider using the value prop. Read that value within any component by using the context consumer."

3. Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals? - wrapper around the useContext internal React hook, which consumes our new context.
