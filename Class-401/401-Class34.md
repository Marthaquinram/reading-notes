## API Integration

### Review API Server Build

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

- "The path parameter defines the resource location, while the query parameter defines sort, pagination, or filter operations. " - abstractapi.com

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

- http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things

- Domain: http://our-site.com
- v3
- model name: stuff
- id: things

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

### Review Auth Server Build

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.

- Basic authentication is where the user ID and password-based authentication takes place in a browser-generated input screen. Form authentication performs the user ID and password-based authentication in a form page which requires the user's input. - <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/basic-authentication#:~:text=Basic%20authentication%20is%20where%20the,a%20browser%2Dgenerated%20input%20screen.&text=Form%20authentication%20performs%20the%20user,which%20requires%20the%20user's%20input.>>
- Bearer Authentication, also known as token authentication, is a two-step process. In this model, you, the user of an API, must first acquire a token and then use the token to authenticate & authorize your requests - <testfull.io>

2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.

- This involves the Authorization request and the access token request. The access token is the end goal because it allows the app to finally access the user's information.

3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.

- RBAC allows you to give access to certain users based on their role with the organization. and what ever role is given will determine how much they can see and do.
