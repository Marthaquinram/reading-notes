## Application State with Redux

### Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

1. What is the first principle of Redux?- whether your app is a really simple app or if its complex app. with lots of data state.
2. what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store? - Store holds the current state. we use the 3 methods from Redux, getState(), dispatch() and subscribe().

3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

- getState() - it retieves the current state of the Redux store
- dispatch() - (commonly used method) this lets you dispatch actions to change the state of your application. Ex: store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'});
- subscribe() - it lets you reguister a callback that the Redux store will call any time an action has been dispatch, that can update your UI of your app. to reflect current application state.

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

- its a helper function that turns an object whose valiues are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
