# Prep: Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I can offer a blend of diversity, perseverance and a passionate qualified candidate with over 12 years of customer services experience. I worked on a large team of personal bankers at a credit union, lead and trained a group of servers in a restaurant and supported over 50-60 employees with complex transactions. I am ambitious and commit myself to everything I do. I focus on professionalism and quality in ever goal.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Based on the readings and videos using the 5 Whys would be something to try. Problem solving is a big part of this industry, working on understanding what the issue is before moving on to searching for solutions. Make a plan; like writing pseudo code and commenting the steps to take. Break the problem down in smaller problems instead of one big one, and repeat/practice.

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to build strong soft and hard skills.
