# Prep: The Growth Mindset

 Learning to have a growth mindset can be challenging at first. We are often scared to fail, and learning something new means you fail... A LOT.
 Just like learning to ride a bike, we dont get it down on the first try, we fall again and again. You put in the work to learn/practice until you eventually get it down and begin to fall less and less. Its the hard work and dedication that goes into it that makes you succeed. The Carol Dweck video got me thinking about what it was like for me growing up in school. I grew up with a fixed mindset, and this translated to me feeling defeated all the time in school when I didnt get a good grade and/or didnt pass a test, it caused me to compare myself with those around me. This brought me a lot of self doubt and very little confidence. Looking back now Im proud that I have grown so much mentally! I know failure is inevitable, and its all apart of the process to become successfull and learning consistently. When I fail or break something I just keep going because I know I will eventually grasp the concepts I'm leaning. The sooner we can accept that, the more we grow.

Here are somethings that can help with building a stronger mindset and achieve that growth mindset in any situation you encounter.

* Be open minded
* Learn to learn
* Grow with others, be inspired by them
* Accept Feedback
* Put in the hard work.

3 Reminders that help keep me in a growth mindset:

1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections
2. Value the process over the end results
3. Always be a student, stay learning.
