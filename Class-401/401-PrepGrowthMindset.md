# Prep: The Growth Mindset

Learning to have a growth mindset can be challenging at first. We are often scared to fail, and learning something new means you fail… A LOT. Just like learning to ride a bike, we don't get it down on the first try, we fall again and again. You put in the work to learn/practice until you eventually get it down and begin to fall less and less. It's the hard work and dedication that goes into it that makes you succeed. The Carol Dweck video got me thinking about what it was like for me growing up in school. I grew up with a fixed mindset, and this translated to me feeling defeated all the time in school when I didn't get a good grade and/or didn't pass a test, it caused me to compare myself with those around me. This brought me a lot of self-doubts and very little confidence. Looking back now I'm proud that I have grown so much mentally! I know failure is inevitable, and it's all a part of the process to become successful and learning consistently. When I fail or break something I just keep going because I know I will eventually grasp the concepts I’m learning. The sooner we can accept that, the more we grow.

Here are some things that can help with building a stronger mindset and achieving that growth mindset in any situation you encounter.

Be open-minded
Learn to learn
Grow with others, be inspired by them
Accept Feedback
Put in the hard work.

3 Reminders that help keep me in a growth mindset:

Acknowledge and embrace imperfections
Value the process over the end results
Always be a student, and stay learning.
