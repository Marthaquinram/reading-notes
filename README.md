About Me

My name is Martha, I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA now residing in Seattle, WA. I'm excited to become a software developer, and learn as much as I can. I currently work for a credit union where Ive been working in finances for almost 6 years. I want to prove to myself that I can be successful in the tech world and break down any myths/stereotypes in regard to females in the tech industry. I look forward to learn and soaking up all the new knowledge and making my way into the tech world.
