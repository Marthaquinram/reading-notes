# My Notes


# Hello, Everyone

My name is *Martha* and this is what **Growth Mindset** means to me.
 
 GROWTH MINDSET
 
 ~~Is VERY easy.~~
 Learning to have a growth mindset can be challenging at first. We are often scared to fail, and learning something new means you fail... A LOT.
 But thats not to say you should give up and never try to learn something new or challenging ever again. Having a growth mindset means you are giving yourself an opportunity to fail and learn from that failure. Just like learning to ride a bike, we dont get it down on the first try, we fall again and again. You put in the work to learn to ride a bike until you eventually get it down and begin to fall less and less. Its the hard work and dedication that goes into it that makes you succeed. 

Here are somethings that can help with building a stronger mindset and achieve that growth mindset in any situation you encounter.
* Be open minded
* Learn to learn
* Grow with others, be inspired by them
* Accept Feedback
* Put in the hard work.

3 Reminders that help keep me in a growth mindset:
1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections
2. Value the process over the end results
3. Always be a student, stay learning.
