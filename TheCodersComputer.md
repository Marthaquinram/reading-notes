## Learning Markdown

*What is Markdown?*

Markdown is basic writing and formatting syntax aimed to make writing on the internet easier. It allows you to make things easier to read. Markdown allows you to make things **Bold** or *Italicized* by simply using ***syntax***.

Here are the syntax I have learned so far.

1. Headings
    - The # sign is used for choosing how large or small you want to showcase a word or sentance. For example
      - # Hi
        - ## Hello
           - ### Hola
   - The number # signs you enter in 6 being the most you can use will determine how big or small that word or sentence is.
   
 2. Styling
    - Then theres styling, this allows you to make words or sentences bold, italicized, Strikethrough, Bold and nested italic, and All bold and italic.â€ƒ
    - Here are some examples:
      - *Bold* Using ** ** or __ __
        - **Italicized** Using * * or _ _ 
          - ~~Strikethrough~~ Using ~~ ~~
            - **Bold _and_ nested italic** Using ** ** and _ _
               - ***All bold and italic*** Using *** ***
