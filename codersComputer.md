## **Top 3 Strengths**

- Curiosity 
- Openness
- Listening

*Curiosity* - Being curious as to how things work is a big thing for me, I like to know the ins and outs of why something works the way it does, and in software development there is so many different commands to learn and I understanding how they work will help with overall understanding of coding.

*Openness* - this is one of my strengths becasue I'm always open to learning new things, even if its out my comfort zone, I like getting constructive feedback as well as learning from others. Being open minded puts you in a position to learn from the people around you and see things in a different POV that maybe you didnt think to view it from.

*Listening* - Active listening will help with understanding someone elses perspective or feedback theyre giving. Maintaining eye contact and non verbal gestures show you are engaged in the conversation. This allows you to understand the message that is being conveyed accross the board and this will help in a collaborative setting as well as one one interation.

## **Top 3 areas of growth**

- Creativity
- Root Cause Resolution
- Decision Making

1. Creativity - is one of my weakness and areas of growth. It often takes me some time to really think of ideas on the spot, I usually have to sit on something for a while to spark up an idea that could be useful. The way Im planing to work on this is by communicating ideas with others on the team and getting feedback on it.


2. Root Cause Resolution - Finding the root of the issue can take sometime and often times I dont see the root of the issue right away and this could cause issues if its a time sensitve situation. I will work on this by seeking guideance and brainstorming resolutions with others on the team.

3. Decision Making - I have struggled to make decision for a lot of different reasons, and this is also one of the top things I want to work on. My biggest hurdle is the fear of making a bad decision that could potentially ruin or break something so bad that it impacts others based on that one decision. I plan on improving my decision making by asking an expert on the task at hand how to approach an issue as well as making a plan, thinking it through and laying something out can help with the bigger picture and seeing possible solutions to make a decision.
